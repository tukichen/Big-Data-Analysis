## 3. Top K - Hot Topic Analysis

Social media networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, provide exciting opportunities that can open up a new era
of social science research.The data extracted from social media has gained a growing interest among many researchers attempting to better understand the nature and power of social media. So In this project we are accessing tweets and tokenizing them to find out top k-words used at any given interval of time(in our case k varies from 1 to 100). We are hoping that our project can be used as a tool to find patterns,news feeds etc.
